Andrew Watkins' Mars Rover Java
==

###How to Execute Program

1) Open the program in Java IDE of your choice.

2) Navigate to "src/main/Application.java."

3) Run the "Application.java" file.

4) The expected output will appear in the IDE console.

###Assumptions Made

* The input will not include an initial bearing for a rover that is outside of the plateau.

* There would only be one file with the commands.  

* The rover should not be able to go out of the bounds of the plateau.  The program prohibits traveling out of bounds of the plateau.

* Commands may not always be cased properly so the code is not case sensitive.  

##Thank you for taking the time to review my work!  

####Please take into consideration that this is my first time  writing a program in Java.  Thanks!
